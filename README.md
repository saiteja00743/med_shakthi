## 📌 About The Project

**Med Shakthi** is a production-grade mobile application developed during my internship at **UptoSkills**. 

Unlike typical tutorial apps, this project focuses on **real-world engineering challenges**: handling data persistence, managing complex state across screens, ensuring secure authentication with Supabase, and integrating location services.

> **Note:** This project serves as an educational milestone demonstrating scalable architecture and professional Flutter development practices.
